# Installing the dependencies

This frontend uses react-native. To view this on react:

1. `npm install`
    - This is for default start
2. `npx expo install react-dom react-native-web @expo/metro-runtime`
    - Making it able to run on web (these dependencies must be installed to view on web)

# Run on dev mode

1. `npm start`
2. Press `w` to view on web view

(TODO: Viewing on Android iOS etc)
